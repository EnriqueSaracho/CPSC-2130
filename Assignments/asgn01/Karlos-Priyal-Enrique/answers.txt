QUESTIONS:
1. What is the website trying to communicate? What is the purpose?
The purpose is entertainment and how you can use Machine Learning in a fun way. It communicates that AI is advanced enough to be part of a game; it doesn't need to be used only for academic or work purposes.

2. What types of media does it use?
Audio, visual (graphics & text), video, AI.

3. How are these media used to communicate? How are they more effective than simple text and pictures?
Audio media - provides audio feedback especially helpful for disabled users.
Graphic media - canvas to draw the doodles on.
Video media - the game provides a tutorial for the user, easier to understand than text and pictures.
AI media - generates an entity that resembles a player.


4. List one or two things you like about the way the site uses media and explain why you like them.
It allows user creativity by providing a canvas (graphical media) to draw.
It adds interactivity by giving audio feedback to the user. 

5. List one or two things you think could be improved. Specifically, explain how you think these things could be improved and provide suggestions. No site is perfect, so you should be able to come up with at least one thing
Multiplayer mode: it would be more fun to allow multiple players to compete and try to make the AI guess their drawings first.
Audio feedback is too robotic: There are a lot of AI voices currently that could enhance user experience.
Graphic User Interface could be improved: Some font sizes are too small, and the use of colors like white font on a bright yellow background could be hard to see for some users. The choice of font types and sizes seems random and unorganized. There is an inconsistent color scheme.
